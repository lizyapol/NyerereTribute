          Here's is the time line for a well lived life of Mwal. Nyerere
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>1922</b> - Julius Kambarage Nyerere was born on 13 April 1922 in
            Mwitongo, an area of the village of Butiama in Tanganyika's Mara
            Region.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1934</b> - Nyerere began his education at the Native
            Administration School in Mwisenge, Musoma in February 1934, about 25
            miles from his home.Nyerere excelled at the school, and after six
            months his exam results were such that he was allowed to skip a
            grade.He avoided sporting activities and preferred to read in his
            dormitory during free time.His academic excellence allowed him to
            gain a government scholarship to attend the elite Tabora Government
            School, a secondary school in Tabora.There, he again avoided
            sporting activities but helped to set up a Boy Scout's brigade after
            reading Scouting for Boys.He was heavily involved in the school's
            debating society,and teachers recommended him as head prefect, but
            this was vetoed by the headmaster, who described Nyerere as being
            "too kind" for the position.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1943</b> - In October 1942, Nyerere completed his secondary
            education and decided to study at Makerere College in the Ugandan
            city of Kampala.He secured a bursary to fund a teacher training
            course there, arriving in Uganda in January 1943.At Makerere, he
            studied alongside many of East Africa's most talented
            students,although spent little time socialising with others, instead
            focusing on his reading.He took courses in chemistry, biology,
            Latin, and Greek.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1947</b> - On leaving Makerere, Nyerere returned home to Zanaki
            territory to build a house for his widowed mother, before spending
            his time reading and farming in Butiama. He was offered teaching
            positions at both the state-run Tabora Boys' School and the
            mission-run St Mary's, but chose the latter despite it offering a
            lower wage.He took part in a public debate with two teachers from
            the Tabora Boys' School, in which he argued against the statement
            that "The African has benefitted more than the European since the
            partition of Africa"; after winning the debate, he was subsequently
            banned from returning to the school. Outside school hours, he gave
            free lessons in English to older locals, and also gave talks on
            political issues.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1949</b> - In October 1949 he was accepted for entry to study for
            a Master of Arts degree at the University of Edinburgh's Faculty of
            Arts; his was an Ordinary Degree of Master of Arts which, in
            contrast to common uses of the term "Master of Arts", was considered
            an undergraduate rather than postgraduate degree, the equivalent of
            a Bachelor of Arts in most English universitiesNyerere was one of
            only two black students from the British East African territories
            studying in Scotland.In the first year of his MA studies, he took
            courses in English literature, political economy, and social
            anthropology; in the latter, he was tutored by Ralph Piddington.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1952</b> - Having sailed aboard the SS Kenya Castle, Nyerere
            arrive back in Dar es Salaam in October 1952.He took the train to
            Mwanza and then a lake steamer to Musoma before reaching Zanaki
            lands.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1954</b> - On 7 July 1954 Nyerere, assisted by Oscar Kambona,
            transformed the TAA into a new political party, the Tanganyika
            African National Union (TANU).Among the early TANU members were the
            three sons of Kleist Sykes, Dossa Aziz, and John Rupia, the latter
            an entrepreneur who had established himself as one of the wealthiest
            indigenous Africans in the country.Rupia served as the group's first
            treasurer and largely funded the organisation in its early years
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1955</b> - Nyerere returned to Dar es Salaam in October 1955.From
            then until Tanzania secured independence, he toured the country
            almost continuously, often in TANU's Land Rover. The British
            colonial Governor of Tanganyika, Edward Twining, disliked Nyerere,
            regarding him as a racialist who wanted to impose indigenous
            domination over the European and South Asian minorities. In December
            1955, Twining established the "multi-racial" United Tanganyika Party
            (UTP) to combat TANU's African nationalist message.Nyerere
            nevertheless stipulated that "we are fighting against colonialism,
            not against the whites"
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1958</b> - Twining announced that elections for a new legislative
            council would take place in early 1958. These would be organised
            around ten constituencies, each electing three members of the
            council: one indigenous African, one European, and one South
            Asian.At a January 1958 conference in Tabora, Nyerere convinced TANU
            to take part. In these elections, which took place over the course
            of 1958 and 1959, TANU won every seat it contested.Nyerere stood as
            TANU's candidate in the Eastern Province seat against an independent
            candidate, Patrick Kunambi, securing 2600 votes to Kunambi's 800.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1959</b> - In March 1959, the new British Governor of Tanganyika,
            Richard Turnbull, gave TANU five of the twelve ministerial posts
            available in the colony's government. Turnbull was prepared to work
            for a peaceful transition to independence.In 1959, Nyerere visited
            Edinburgh.In 1960, he attended a conference of independent African
            states in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, at which he presented a paper
            calling for the formation of an East African Federation. He
            suggested that Tanganyika could delay its attainment of independence
            from the British Empire until neighbouring Kenya and Uganda were
            able to do the same. In his view, it would be much easier for the
            three countries to unite at the same point as independence than
            after it, for beyond that point their respective governments might
            feel that they were losing sovereignty through unification.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1960</b> - In the August 1960 general election, TANU won 70 of
            the 71 available seats. As TANU's leader, Nyerere was called to form
            a new government; he became its chief minister.That year, British
            Prime Minister Harold Macmillan gave his "Wind of Change" speech,
            indicating British willingness to dismantle the empire in Africa.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1961</b> - On 9 December 1961, Tanganyika gained independence, an
            event marked by a ceremony at National Stadium. A law was soon
            presented to the Assembly that would restrict citizenship to
            indigenous Africans; Nyerere spoke out against the bill, comparing
            its racialism to the ideas of Adolf Hitler and Hendrik Verwoerd, and
            threatened to resign if it passed.Six weeks after independence, in
            January 1962 Nyerere resigned as Prime Minister, intent on focusing
            on restructuring TANU and trying to "work out our own pattern of
            democracy". Retreating to become a parliamentary back bencher,he
            appointed close political ally Rashidi Kawawa as the new Prime
            Minister.He toured the country, giving speeches in towns and
            villages in which he emphasised the need for self-reliance and hard
            work.In 1962, his alma mater at Edinburgh awarded Nyerere with a
            Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1962</b> - On 9 December 1962, a year after independence,
            Tanganyika became a republic.Nyerere moved into the State House in
            Dar es Salaam, the former official residence of British
            governors.Nyerere disliked life in the building, but remained there
            until 1966.Nyerere appointed Kawawa his Vice President. In 1963, he
            put his name forward to be Rector of Edinburgh University, vowing to
            travel to Scotland whenever needed; the position instead went to the
            actor James Robertson Justice.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1963</b> - Nyerere endorsed the Pan-Africanist idea of unifying
            Africa as a single state, although he disagreed with the Ghanaian
            President Kwame Nkrumah's view that this could be achieved quickly.
            Instead, Nyerere stressed the idea of forming regional
            confederations as short-term steps towards the eventual unification
            of the continent.Pursuing these ideals, in June 1963 Nyerere met
            with Kenyan President Jomo Kenyatta and Ugandan President Milton
            Obote in Nairobi, where they agreed to unite their respective
            countries into a single East African Federation by the end of the
            year.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1964</b> - Following the Zanzibari Revolution, Abeid Karume
            declared himself President of a one-party state and began
            redistributing Arab-owned land among black African peasants.In April
            he visited Karume; the following day they announced the political
            unification of Tanganyika and Zanzibar.Nyerere dismissed suggestions
            that this had anything to do with Cold War power struggles,
            presenting it as a response to Pan-Africanist ideology: "Unity in
            our continent does not have to come via Moscow or Washington.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1965</b> - In the September 1965 general election, a presidential
            vote took place across Tanzania, although parliamentary elections
            occurred only on the mainland and not on Zanzibar.Although the
            one-party state meant that only TANU candidates could stand, the
            party's national executive selected multiple candidates for all but
            six seats, providing some democratic choice for voters.Two
            ministers, six junior ministers, and nine backbenchers lost their
            seats and were replaced.Both Derek Bryceson and Amur Jamal, the two
            non-indigenous cabinet members, were re-elected over black
            opponents.Nyerere stood unopposed in the presidential election,
            although the ballot allowed space to vote against his candidacy;
            ultimately he secured nearly 97% support.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1967</b> - In January 1967, Nyerere attended a TANU National
            Executive meeting at Arusha. There, he presented its Committee with
            a new statement of party principles: the Arusha Declaration.This
            declaration affirmed the government's commitment to building a
            democratic socialist state and stressed the development of an ethos
            of self-reliance.In Nyerere's view, true independence was not
            possible while the country remained dependent on gifts and loans
            from other nations.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1971</b> - In the early 1970s, Nyerere's government accelerated
            the "villagization" process.They hoped that doing so would improve
            agricultural productivity, allowing the country to export more and
            thus funding the development of light industry so that Tanzania
            would be able to produce more consumer goods and rely less on
            imports.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1971</b> - In January 1971, President Obote of Uganda was
            overthrown by a military coup led by Idi Amin. Nyerere refused to
            recognise the legitimacy of Amin's administration and offered Obote
            refuge in Tanzania.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1978</b> - In October 1978, Uganda invaded Tanzania, annexing the
            Kagera Salient.Nyerere decided that Tanzania's response should be
            not only to push the Uganda Army back into Uganda, but to invade the
            latter and overthrow Amin.To achieve this, he mobilized tens of
            thousands of civilian-soldiers to aid the regular army.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1980</b> - In the 1980 Tanzanian general election, Nyerere again
            stood as CCM's candidate for the presidency.He took an active role
            in trying to find a successor.One of his favourites was the
            Zanzibari Seif Sharif Hamad, whom Nyerere brought into the CCM's
            Central Committee.His relationship with Jumbe became strained, and
            he encouraged the latter to resign
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1985</b> - By 1985, Ali Hassan Mwinyi, had arisen as the most
            prominent candidate as Nyerere's successor, and Nyerere ultimately
            agreed to support his candidature. Nyerere stood down as President,
            with Mwinyi replacing him at the 1985 general election.In doing so,
            Nyerere—according to A. B. Assensoh—was "one of the few African
            leaders to have voluntarily, gracefully, and honourably bowed out"
            of governance.This brought him much respect internationally.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1987</b> - In July 1987, Nyerere returned to the University of
            Edinburgh to attend a conference on "The Making of Constitutions and
            the Development of National Identity", where he gave the opening
            address on post-independence Africa.He was invited to chair an
            international committee on the economic problems facing the "Global
            South", where he worked alongside the future Indian Prime Minister
            Manmohan Singh
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1990</b> - In August 1990 Nyerere stepped down as the chair of
            CCM.Before stepping down as CCM chair, he advocated Tanzania's
            transition into a multi-party democracy. He believed that the CCM
            had become too hidebound and corrupt and that competition with other
            parties would force it to improve.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1994</b> - Nyerere remained active in international affairs,
            attending the 1994 Pan-African Congress, held in the Ugandan city of
            Kampala.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1995</b> - After the 1995 elections, the United Nations asked
            Nyerere to step in as a mediator to help end the Burundian Civil
            War.In 1996 the Mwalimu Nyerere Foundation was established though
            which the negotiations could take place; it was modelled on the U.S.
            Carter Center
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1997</b> - In 1997 he gave a speech marking the fortieth
            anniversary of Ghanaian independence in which he expressed renewed
            support for Pan-African ideals and warning against a "return to the
            tribe" across the continent
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1998</b> - By 1998, Nyerere was aware that he had terminal
            leukaemia but kept this from the public.In September 1999 he
            travelled to England for medical care, being hospitalised in St
            Thomas' Hospital, London.There, in early October he had a major
            stroke and was placed in intensive care.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1999</b> - On 14 October 1999 he then died, his wife and six of
            his children at his bedside.
